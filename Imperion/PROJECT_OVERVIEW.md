# PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md

## Purpose

**The Project Overview document** is a human-readable, public file that acts as the canonical source of project context for GPT. Its primary purpose is to enable ChatGPT to understand and persistently recall the full design scope of the ImperionWorld universeâ€”including file structures, project goals, domain workflows, and architectural intent. It serves as the root reference for all future parsing, rule-following, and content creation in the project.

*This line should be removed, it is to see if the GPT can read the file correctly*
